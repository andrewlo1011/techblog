## Buildling blocks of [Drew.vip](https://Drew.vip)

The followng is the building blocks of my blog:


1. [Netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com) 

I use Netlify.com to deploy and host the blog. It gives seamless integration with Github and provides auto build and deployment capability. On the other hand, it also provides [CDN](https://www.netlify.com/products/edge/) feature to cache my site in edge locations. It also offers a free [SSL](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/https-ssl/) auto-renewable certificate. 

2. [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)

I use Gatsby.js and open source starter [gatsby-starter-personal-blog](https://github.com/greglobinski/gatsby-starter-personal-blog) provided by Greg as the template of the blog. I love the simplicity and responsible design and of Greg's blog starter.  It offers full text search by [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com) , [Goggle Analytics](https://analytics.google.com) integration and [Facebook comments](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments/) plug-in.
However, I followed this [link](https://github.com/greglobinski/gatsby-starter-personal-blog/issues/85) to change the Facebook comment plug-in to [DISQUS](https://disqus.com/), as DISQUS provides more social media login options.

3. [GitHub](https://github.com/andrewlo1011)

GitHub is the repository and version control system of my blog. It also works as the integration point to Netlify for auto build and deployment if a new commit is pushed to the master branch.
